This repo contains my final solutions to the problems of the [2017 Vivint Coding Contest](http://goc.vivint.com/). I originally solved the problems using Python, but with the exception of the islands problem, later rewrote all the solutions in Rust. You can find the Rust solutions in src/main.rs in each subdirectory. The Python solutions are also provided in files named "oldrun". In some cases, I modified the python files in the course of testing or debugging the Rust versions later, so they do not necessarily all work or reflect my original Python solutions from day 1 of the contest, but for the most part, they are unchanged. I also included helper scripts I wrote where applicable, such as the fuzzer I wrote to debug my lambda interpreter.
